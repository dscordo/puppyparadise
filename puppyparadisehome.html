  <blockquote>
  <p>Age 10. Sooty is a large black cocker spaniel.
    One of his everyday rituals is running off and barking in the back garden when the front door opens as someone comes in.
    When he was younger he enjoyed stealing socks and used tissues.
    He's friendly with cats, babies and adult humans.
    Does not like the reindeer figure. You need permission to touch his toys.
    Will not get off the sofa even if you ask.</p>
