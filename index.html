  <h3>Sooty</h3>
  <img class="sooty-image img-responsive img-circle" src="images/sooty.jpg">
  <h5>Age 10. Sooty is a large black cocker spaniel.</h5>
      <p>One of his everyday rituals is running off and barking in the back garden when the front door opens as someone comes in.
    When he was younger he enjoyed stealing socks and used tissues.
    He's friendly with cats, babies and adult humans.
    Does not like the reindeer figure. You need permission to touch his toys.
    Will not get off the sofa even if you ask.</p>

<img class="arya-image img-responsive img-circle" src="images/cookie.jpg"
<h5>Age 12.</h5>
<p>She once ate an entire, fully decorated gingerbread house (except the glacier mints which she'd licked and spat back out.
  She farted gingerbread for days.
  She likes pets, rolling around on the floor, and all food ever except chillies (though she will still eat them).
  She dislikes wearing the Christmas outfits we try to get to her to wear every year (except her Christmas jumper which she actually quite likes).
